# [Punch v1.0.0]

Punch is a open source tool that helps you in updating data from CSV to MySQL based on specific Search Key.



## Quick start

Simple four Step Process:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/raghunathj/Punch/).
* Change the database settings and csv file path in config.php.
* Run index.php and select the Database table column you want to search for, and select CSV column to search from.
* Select CSV column data you want to update and select its appropriate db columns which need to be affected. You can update multiple columns in a table by selecting "add column".

## Output

Once the updation is done, you can see the report of what all data was updated and what all failed.

## Failure

Failed Update might be for the following reason:

* The search key/value is not matching with the selected column value.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* The data in CSV is same as in the Database.

## Versioning

<<<<<<< HEAD
For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Punch will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

>>>>>>> 7217fca02afc281db6aba564140915008d1c84a8

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
